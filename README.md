# CSS calc() Function Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates an issue with the CSS `calc()` function where unexpected results occur when combining percentages and pixel values.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a possible workaround.

**Issue:** The `calc()` function doesn't always produce the expected result when mixing units, especially in complex layouts. This can lead to misaligned elements or unexpected rendering.

**Workaround:** The proposed solution might involve restructuring the CSS or using alternative layout techniques to achieve the desired effect.
